# sorting_visualization_using_python_gui
AIM- VISUALIZING SORTING ALGORITHM USING GUI IN PYTHON. SORTING ALGORITHM COVERED.
1.BUBBLE SORT
2.INSERTION SORT
3.MERGE SORT 
4.QUICK SORT
5.SELECTION SORT

DESCRIPTION- Creating a dynamic Tkinter python GUI using its Combobox, Button, and Label classes. We create multiple Sections in our root frame, one canvas, and one sub-frame which we then use to draw a bar graph and place the user inputs. We also generate random data using python's random library and user input. After we have a generated random dataset, we then visualize the given data as a normalized bar graph.

TKINTER DOCUMENTATION-
https://docs.python.org/2/library/tkinter.html

LANGUAGE USED-
PYTHON

LIBRARIES USED-

1.TKINTER
Tkinter is a Python binding to the Tk GUI toolkit

2.RANDOM Python has a built-in module that you can use to make random numbers.

PERSONAL NOTE- 
This project really helped me to understand GUI using Tkinter and sorting algorithm. I also learned about color schemes for a good UI.
