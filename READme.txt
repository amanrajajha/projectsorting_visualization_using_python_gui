AIM- VISUALIZING SORTING ALGORITHM USING GUI IN PYTHON.
SORTING ALGORITHM COVERED.
1.BUBBLE SORT
2.INSERTION SORT
3.MERGE SORT
4.QUICK SORT
5.SELECTION SORT

DISCRIPTION-
Creating a dynamic tkinter python GUI using its Combobox, Button and Label classes. 
We create multiple Sections in our root frame, one canvas and one sub-frame which we than use to draw a bar graph and
 place the user inputs.
We also generate random data using python's random library and the user input. 
After we have a generated random dataset, we than visualize the given data as a normalized bar graph.

Python has a built-in module that you can use to make random numbers.


PERSONAL NOTE- This project really helped me to understand gui using tkinter 
and sorting algorithm. I also learned about colorschemes for a good ui .
